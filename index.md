_**[Measuring Sentiment in S&P 500 Company 10Ks](report/report.md)**_

This report is a cross-sectional event study that looks to answer the question of if positive or negative sentiment in a 10-K is associated with better or worse stock returns. Specifically, I tried to see the tone of each 10-K filing by scanning the documents for words with positive or negative sentiment that I defined using the Machine Learning positive and negative sentiment datasets and the Loughran McDonald, or LM, Master Dictionary which can be found in the inputs file. In addition to this question, I also scanned through each 10-K to find out how often words under my three reserach topics, these being Countries facing conflict, the COVID pandemic, and crypto currencies, appeared next to positive and negative sentiment words and how this correlated to the firm's stock returns at the time. 

From my analysis, I found that there is little or no relationship between the overall document sentiment as well as my contextual sentiment variables and the 2 and 10 days returns around the firm's filing date. As seen in the report, there is a fairly even distribution among sentiment scores when plotted against 2 and 10 day returns. The primary thing that stood out to me from my contextual analysis was when countries in conflict were talked about with positive sentiment it had a significantly higher correlation to the returns around the filing date then when they were discussed with negative sentiment. 

Please open and read my report linked above to read more about my findings and analysis process.
